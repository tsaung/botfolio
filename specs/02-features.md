## 5. Phase 2 — Planned Features (The "Brain")

> [!NOTE]
> The following features are **deferred to Phase 2**. The "Improve with AI" page (`/improve`) is scaffolded but hidden from the sidebar.

- **Improve with AI (Content Studio):** An interactive "Canvas" for generating high-quality RAG content.

  - **UI:** Split-pane layout (Chat Interface + Live Preview).
  - **Model Selector:** Dropdown to switch models during the session.
- **AI-Generated Knowledge:** Documents derived from other sources (lower confidence, reviewable). Adds "AI Generated" tab and "Source" column to Knowledge Base.
- **RAG Pipeline:** ~~Vectorize documents (Markdown/Text) for retrieval.~~ → **Implemented** (automatic chunking + embedding via `gemini-embedding-001`).
- **Enrichment Agent:** An "Admin Agent" that helps the owner generate high-quality RAG documents.
- **Generative UI:** Dynamic widgets (`streamUI`) for project cards and contact forms.
