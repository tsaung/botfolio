# AutoFolio

**AutoFolio** is an AI-native portfolio platform that "interviews" for you. It combines a sleek, modern chat interface with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to answer questions about your experience, projects, and skills accurately.

> **Status:** Active Development
> **Stack:** Next.js, Supabase, Vercel AI SDK, Shadcn UI

## Features (Planned)
- **Visitor Chat:** A conversational interface for recruiters and clients.
- **Generative UI:** The AI renders rich components (Project Cards, Contact Forms) in the chat.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Manage your profile and documents.
- **Profile Enrichment:** Chat with the AI to generate RAG-optimized summaries of your experience.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoFolio.git
    cd AutoFolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
